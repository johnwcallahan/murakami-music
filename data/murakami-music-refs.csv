Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage,Liszt,Le mal du pays,Classical,55-56,"""Franz Liszt's 'Le mal du pays.' It's from his Years of Pilgrimage suite 'Year 1: Switzerland.'"" 
""'Le mal du...'?"" 
""'Le mal du pays.' It's French. Usually it's translated as 'homesickness,' or 'melancholy.' If you put a finer point on it, it's more like 'a groundless sadness called forth in a person's heart by a pastoral landscape.' It's a hard expression to translate accurately.""
""A girl I know used to play that piece a lot. A classmate of mine in high school."" 
""I've always liked this piece. It's not very well known, though,"" Haida said. ""Was your friend a good pianist?""
""Hard to say. I don't know much about music. But every time I heard it I thought it was beautiful. How should I put it? It had a calm sadness, but wasn't sentimental.""
""Then she must have played it well,"" Haida said. ""The piece seems simple technically, but it's hard to get the expression right. Play it just as it's written on the score, and it winds up pretty boring. But go the opposite route and interpret it too intensely, and it sounds cheap. Just the way you use the pedal makes all the difference, and can change the entire character of the piece.""
""Who's the pianist here?""
""A Russian, Lazar Berman. When he plays Liszt it's like he's painting a delicately imagined landscape. Most people see Liszt's piano music as more superficial, and technical. Of course, he was some tricky pieces, but if you listen very carefully to his music you discover a depth to it that you don't notice at first. Most of the time it's hidden behind all the embellishments. This is particularly true of the Years of Pilgrimage suites. There aren't many living pianists who can play it accurately and with such beauty. Among more contemporary pianists, Berman gets it right, and with the older pianists I'd have to go with Claudio Arrau.""",49seS8lx8rIUhJMIDVPFah?si=4LQISoytQc6UY0idRfb7AQ
Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage,Franz Liszt,Le mal du pays,Classical,259,"""Eri stood up, went over to the small stereo set in the cabinet, selected a CD from the pile of discs, and inserted it into the player. ""Le mal du pays"" filtered out from the speakers, the simple opening melody, softly played with one hand. Eri sat back down across from him, and the two of them silently listened to the music.
Listening to the music here, next to a lake in Finland, it had a different sort of charm from when he heard it back in his apartment in Tokyo. But no matter where he listened to it, regardless of whether he heard it on a CD or an old LP, the music remained the same, utterly engaging and beautiful. Tsukuru pictured Yuzu at the piano in her parlor, playing the piece, leaning over the keyboard, eyes closed, lips slightly open, searching for words that don't make a sound. She was apart from herself then, in some other place.",49seS8lx8rIUhJMIDVPFah?si=4LQISoytQc6UY0idRfb7AQ

Kafka on the Shore,Schubert,Sonata in D Major,Classical,110-111,"""When I drive I like to listen to Schubert's piano sonatas with the volume turned up. Do you know why?""
""I have no idea.""
Because playing Schubert's piano sonatas well is one of the hardest things in the world. Especially this, the Sonata in D Major."" It's a tough piece to master. Some pianists can play one or maybe two of the movements perfectly, but if you listen to all four movements as a unified whole, no one has ever nailed it. A lot of famous pianists have tried to rise to the challenge, but it's like there's always something missing. There's never one where you can say, Yes! He's got it! Do you know why?""
No, I reply.
Because the sonata itself is imperfect. Robert Schumann understood Schubert's sonatas well, and he labeled this one 'Heavenly Tedious.'
...""If you play Schubert's sonatas, especially this one straight through, it's not art. Like Schumann pointed out, it's too long and too pastoral, and technically too simplistic. Play it through the way it is and it's flat and tasteless, some dusty antique. Which is why every pianist who attempts it adds something of his own, something extra. Like this–hear how he articulates it there? Adding rubato. Adjusting the pace, modulation, whatever. Otherwise they can't hold it all together. They have to be careful, though, or else all those extra devices destroy the dignity of the piece. Then it's not Schubert's music anymore. Every single pianist who's played this sonata struggles with the same paradox.""","https://open.spotify.com/track/3rDLZ3nFQ1bCbtfSIWVTMr?si=oKZiotFcQg-cDnQl1Upqzw,https://open.spotify.com/track/1gMZT7egBnrU6OVPKVKnyh?si=u6BsiH5VRVOBg5zgE29FmA,https://open.spotify.com/track/18uuO9PfN2RwIMEHIHG7bR?si=XZ7qZ7-pQlW48aw-aBY3Sw,https://open.spotify.com/track/2OcbOWbpMb6y5D1JZ2dkgN?si=wipIe3TKQw-rC_DHHjOQmA"
